Make the bot play a totally random hand: `!pyx`
... with 1 blank:  `!pyx 1`
... with 2 blanks: `!pyx 2`
... with 3 blanks: `!pyx 3`

Make the bot fill in the blanks: `!pyx ____ is the name of my ____ coverband`

Play white cards with `w <card text>` and the bot will select a suitable black card at random.
... one card:  `!pyx w A Big Black Dick`
... two cards: `!pyx w Utilikilt w Paul and Storm`

White cards can also be random by using `w ?`.
... One random white card on a random black card: `!pyx w ?` (This is functionally equivalent to `!pyx 1`)
... One random white card with a custom white card: `!pyx w ? w This is my best card`

You can also limit the number of words found on any white card the bot picks by adding a number to the end of the pyx command:
... Limit all white cards to 5 words or fewer: `!pyx5`
... Limit all white cards to 3 words or fewer: `!pyx3 The bot is horny for ____ again.`
... Limit all white cards to a single word: `!pyx1 I AM ____ I LIKE ____`

Finally, if you write an all-caps black card the bot will fill in the blanks in all-caps as well.
